All the parameters are optional, they contain a default value in case they are not specified. You can specify them in any order when running the program in the command line.

```
notes: The numerical value of notes in the scale, in C Major would be something like 0:C, 1:D, 2:E, 3:F and so on...
The scale is C major by default, it's hardcoded in the main.py file and can be modified.

lyrics: The text where spaces delimit w

dur: The BPM of each note

lang: the language code, "es" for spanish and "en" for english.

There are several languages supported, can check that here http://espeak.sourceforge.net/languages.html

tempo: The tempo in BPM, 100 by default

file: the name of the output file
```

Usage examples
```
python main.py notes=0,0,2 lyrics="hello good morning" dur=1,1,2 lang=en file="output.wav" tempo=80

python main.py lyrics="hola hola hola" lang=es

python main.py # All the default values are used generating a single note audio file which says "Ooh" in spanish

```

You can easily modify `main.py` and add notes, duration, language and more as parameters.
